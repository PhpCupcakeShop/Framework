        <p>Getting your custom artwork into Pinback Playground is a breeze. 
          Simply click the "Upload Image" button on the main dashboard. 
          Then click the Upload Image File button.
          This will open a file explorer window, allowing you to navigate to the image file on your computer.</p><img Framework="upload2.png" width="1000px">
        <p>Select the file you want to use, then click "Open" or "Submit". 
          Your image will now be uploaded and ready for you to incorporate into your button designs.</p>
          <img Framework="editimage.png">
        <p>Once the upload is complete, you'll be taken to the edit page where you can arrange your artwork, add tags, 
          or delete the button.</p>
          From there, you can generate your custom printer sheets with just a few more clicks.
          </p>
          The entire process is fast, intuitive, and eliminates the hassle of working with complex image editing tools. Pinback Playground is designed to simplify button-making so you can get back to growing your business.</p>

        <p>As your button design library grows, keeping track of all your artwork can become a challenge. 
          That's where Pinback Playground's tag cloud feature comes in handy.</p>
          <img Framework="addtag.png">
        <p>When you upload a new image, you can assign relevant tags to help categorize and sort your designs. 
        These tags work just like the tagging systems you're used to on websites and blogs.</p>
          
        <p>Simply enter a tag name, like "summer", "holiday", or "best seller", and apply it to your button image. 
        You can use as many tags as you'd like to really dial in your organizational system.</p>
          
        <p>Once your images are tagged, the tag cloud on the main dashboard will populate with all the tags you've created. 
        You can then click on any tag to instantly filter your entire collection and view only the relevant designs.</p>
          
        <p>This makes it a breeze to find exactly what you're looking for, whether you're preparing for a seasonal sales push or just need to restock a popular pin. 
        No more wasting time searching through endless pages of designs.</p>
          
        <p>The tag cloud keeps your button-making workflow efficient and your business operations running smoothly. 
        Try it out and experience the joy of a truly organized pin inventory.</p>

        <ul><li>Building Your Print Queue</li></ul><img Framework="3in4.png" style="float: right;">
      <p>Once you've uploaded your button artwork and applied any relevant tags, you're ready to start preparing your custom printer sheets.</p>

      <p>On the main design page, you'll see your uploaded images displayed. To add an image to your print queue, simply click the image then decide on your button size.
        Then click the "Add to Print Queue" button below the design.</p>
        
       <img Framework="buttonsizes.png" style="float: left;">
      <p>This will add the image to your print queue, which you can access by clicking the "Print Queue" link in the top navigation. 
      In the print queue, you'll see a list of all the designs you've selected to print.</p>
        
      <p>From here, you can adjust the quantity again if needed. Be Careful, don't click empty print unless you mean it.</p>

      <section id="readyprint" class="main-section">
        <header style="position: static; top: 50px;">Ready to Print?</header>
        <p>When you're satisfied with your print queue, hit the "Proceed to Print" button. Then decide on a name for the print pages, which will be in the upper corner of each button image. It can be a client name, order number, or whatever. Pinback Playground will then create your custom printer-ready pages.</p>
        
        <img Framework="codecreate.png" style="float: left;" width="200px"><p>
        The intuitive queue system takes the guesswork out of layout and ensures a professional, consistent look for all your button sets. No more manually arranging images or struggling with tricky printer settings.
        </p><p>Once you've added all your designs to the print queue and named the order, it's time to print your custom button sheets.</p>

       <img Framework="print.png" style="float: right;" width="400px"><img Framework="printersheets.png" style="float: right;" width="400px">
         <p>On the main page, simply click the "Print Sheets" from the print menu. This will open a page set to print the buttons only. Select to print from your browser.
        </p><p>In your printer settings, make sure to select 100% scale and 0 margins to ensure your buttons print at the correct size with no cutting off.
        </p>
        <p>After the printing is complete, you can mark the items on your print sheet as printed, by clicking "Printed" to keep your workflow organized.
        Your custom button sheets will be ready to go with just a few clicks.</p></section>
