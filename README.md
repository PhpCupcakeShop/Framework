### Homemade cupcakes shine,

### Boxed mix still brings delight,

### Butter and milk's might.

## [demo available on website](https://phpcupcake.shop)

 PhpCupcakeShop will be an option for a framework that provides a code-from-scratch feel.  With classes and methods out of the box, a developer should be able to start building pages right away.  With generic calls to the database, and straightforward variables to implement, this server-side software framework should provide a scalable opportunity for the potential enterprise.  Every software should be simple for the user and the developer, not having to jump through hoops to access certain elements or code.  PhpCupcakeShop takes advantage of the ability of PHP to use semantic coding.  Written from scratch, as a framework should be, PhpCupcakeShop should be compatible with external dependencies (without any dependencies itself!) To implement the separation of duties, the framework follows an MVC (model-view-controller) model at its core.  There are little rules to the framework making it flexible to convert a site.

## [HELPFUL EXTERNAL SITES]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To get started in PHP you will need a development/testing server:

### [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)

> [!NOTE]
> W3Schools I find the easiest to understand out of the reference sites out there:

### [W3Schools: PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp)

## [CONTRIBUTING]
> If anyone would like to make an equivalent to my batch file to build model files in shell/Linux, or bash/MacOS and as long as it works, it would be linked to from here.

> Tutorials external from the documentation would be appreciated as I would like to make the framework very easy for beginners.  More of my time can then be spent building more of the framework and the documentation can remain simple and straightforward. If any are made after version 1.0 release, please send me a link and I may link to it.

> The process for support on modules and plugins is still in the making. There should be little rules to making a plugin, and the only one to date, is the directory structure for the Model Object and Model Relationship files.
