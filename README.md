## The Sprinkles of PHP Frameworks
PhpCupcakeShop will be an option for a framework that provides a code-from-scratch feel.  With classes and methods out of the box, a developer should be able to start building pages right away.  With generic calls to the database, and straight forward variables to implement, this server-side software framework should provide a scalable opportunity for the potential enterprise.  Every software should be simple for the user and the developer, no having to jump through hoops to access certain elements or code.  PhpCupcakeShop takes advantage of the ability of PHP to use semantic coding.  Written from scratch, as a framework should be, PhpCupcakeShop should be compatible with external dependencies (without any dependencies itself!) To implement separation of duties, the framework follows a MVC (model-view-controller) model at its core.
##Work still needed before completion:
* Confirmation pages for CRUD operations.
* Rename files to have special extensions so coders can tell the difference between their own, configurable files, and the code of the framework.
