# PhpCupcakeShop v0.6.1

### Homemade cupcakes shine,

### Boxed mix still brings delight,

### Butter and milk's might.

## [demo available](https://demo.phpcupcake.shop)

PhpCupcakeShop will be an option for a framework that provides a code-from-scratch feel.  With classes and methods out of the box, a developer should be able to start building pages right away.  With generic calls to the database, and straightforward variables to implement, this server-side software framework should provide a scalable opportunity for the potential enterprise.  Every software should be simple for the user and the developer, not having to jump through hoops to access certain elements or code.  PhpCupcakeShop takes advantage of the ability of PHP to use semantic coding.  Written from scratch, as a framework should be, PhpCupcakeShop should be compatible with external dependencies (without any dependencies itself!) To implement the separation of duties, the framework follows an MVC (model-view-controller) model at its core.
