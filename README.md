# PhpCupcakeShop
## Cupcakes are more fun made from scratch, yet are just as great when it's the mix, and the oil and water are replaced with butter and milk.
PhpCupcakeShop will be an option for a framework that provides a code-from-scratch feel.  With classes and methods out of the box, a developer should be able to start building pages right away.  With generic calls to the database, and straight forward variables to implement, this server-side software framework should provide a scalable opportunity for the potential enterprise.  Every software should be simple for the user and the developer, no having to jump through hoops to access certain elements or code.  PhpCupcakeShop takes advantage of the ability of PHP to use semantic coding.  Written from scratch, as a framework should be, PhpCupcakeShop should be compatible with external dependencies (without any dependencies itself!) To implement separation of duties, the framework follows a MVC (model-view-controller) model at its core.
## Work still needed before completion:
* Confirmation pages for CRUD operations.
* Rename files to have special extensions so coders can tell the difference between their own, configurable files, and the code of the framework.
* Make 404 and other similar pages.
* Fix the search when no table is selected.
* Add table name to post values in case of two like column names.
* Make a url parameter helper
* Protect Data
* Make error handling logs
* Fix a bug when there is nothing in the database, site is completely not functional.
* Research accessibility in webdesign and implement it into views.
* Find a way to organize meta tags so a digital marketer can edit fields easily, if feasible.
* Sort by function when listing data.
* Implement relational databasing and reassess framework for growth and scalability.
* Sort views and make sure pages allow for clear seperation of duties.
* Add configurable cron jobs for database backups
* Implement a system for plugins and modules.
* Check code to PSR Standards.
* Create bash files to quickly and easily build Models and Views with CRUD operations.
* Write Documentation
* Beta Test
* Publish v1.0
